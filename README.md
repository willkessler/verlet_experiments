# Experiments with Verlet Integration

This repo allows me to experiment with Verlet Integration (vs Euler) as described for instance on [DataGenetics blog](http://datagenetics.com/blog/july22018/index.html).

Primarily these experiments are indented to inform bird simulation efforts [here](https://github.com/willkessler/springs_and_arms).

I also publish this code at Open Processing [here](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/955057).
